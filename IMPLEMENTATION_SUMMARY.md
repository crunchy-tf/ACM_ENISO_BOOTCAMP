## 🎓 Learning Path

Each adventure teaches commands in this progressive order:
1. Basic navigation (pwd, ls, cd, cat)
2. System exploration (ls -l, find, grep)
3. File operations (mkdir, cp, mv, touch, rm)
4. Advanced operations (head, tail, echo, redirection)
5. Network commands (ping, ifconfig, netstat)
6. System administration (env, sudo, ssh, scp)

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Client-Side Only
- No backend required
- No containers or servers
- Runs entirely in the browser
- Perfect for Vercel static hosting

### State Management
- React hooks for component state
- localStorage for persistence
- Immutable state updates
- Efficient re-rendering

### Command Execution Flow
```
User Input → xterm.js → Command Parser → Command Executor
     ↓                                          ↓
Progress Save ← Task Validator ← Output ← Filesystem/Mock
```

### Data Flow
```
Adventure JSON → Load → State → Terminal Component
                   ↓              ↓
              Mission Overlay  ← Task Completion
                   ↓
              Hint System
```

## 📋 Next Steps for You

### 1. Install Dependencies (Required)
```bash
cd /Users/ayoub/Downloads/acm_eniso
pnpm add xterm @xterm/addon-fit @xterm/addon-web-links framer-motion
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Navigate to Terminal Exercise
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Use arrow keys to scroll through slides
- The terminal exercise is the last slide
- OR directly jump to it using the navigation dots on the right

### 4. Test Both Adventures
- Click "Hack the Mainframe" 
- Complete at least the first mission to verify functionality
- Go back and try "Time Traveler's Terminal"
- Test the hint system
- Verify progress saves when refreshing

### 5. Optional Customizations
- Adjust colors in Terminal.tsx theme config
- Modify mission stories in JSON files
- Add more commands in commands.ts
- Create additional adventures

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Students:
1. Navigate to the terminal slide in your presentation
2. Choose an adventure (Hack the Mainframe or Time Traveler)
3. Read the mission story and current objective
4. Type Linux commands in the terminal
5. Get instant feedback and task completion
6. Use hints if stuck (3 levels available)
7. Progress through 6-7 missions
8. Complete all tasks to finish the adventure
9. Try the other adventure to practice more

### Educational Benefits:
- **Learning by doing**: Type real commands, see real results
- **Story engagement**: Narrative keeps students motivated
- **Progressive difficulty**: Start easy, get more complex
- **Guided learning**: Hints available when needed
- **Safe environment**: Can't break anything, fully sandboxed
- **Immediate feedback**: Know instantly if you got it right
- **Gamification**: Missions, tasks, progress tracking

## 💾 Storage & State

### LocalStorage Schema
```typescript
Key: terminal_progress_<adventure_id>

Value: {
  hintsUsed: { taskId: hintLevel },
  completedTasks: [taskId1, taskId2, ...],
  completedMissions: [missionId1, ...],
  currentMissionIndex: number
}
```

### Filesystem State
- Stored in component state during session
- Can be extended to persist in localStorage
- Resets to initial state on adventure restart

  foreground: "#00ff41",  // Change this
  cursor: "#00ff41",      // Change this
}
```

```typescript
// In lib/terminal/commands.ts
case "mycommand":
  return handleMyCommand(args, state)

function handleMyCommand(args: string[], state: TerminalState): CommandResult {
  return { output: "Command output!" }
}
```

### Add New Mission
```json
// In public/stories/adventure.json
{
  "id": "mission_new",
  "title": "New Mission",
  "story": "Story text...",
  "tasks": [...]
}
```

## ✨ Special Features

### Command Patterns
Tasks can match exact commands OR regex patterns:
```json
{
  "command": "ls -l",           // Exact match
  "commandPattern": "grep.*txt" // Regex match
}
```

### Mock Network Responses
All network commands return realistic mock data:
- ping shows latency and packet stats
- ifconfig shows network interfaces
- curl/wget show HTTP responses
- ssh/scp show connection messages

### Environment Variables
Students can use `$VAR` substitution:
```bash
echo $USER     # Shows username
echo $HOME     # Shows home directory
```

### I/O Redirection
Supports output redirection:
```bash
echo "text" > file.txt    # Overwrite
echo "more" >> file.txt   # Append
```
